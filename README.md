Overview

Your client has launched a pop-up café in a busy business district. 

They are offering home-made lunches and refreshments to the surrounding offices. 

As such, they require a software application which helps them to log and track orders.


Requirements as a business:

• I want to maintain a collection of products and couriers.

• When a customer makes a new order,I need to create this on the system.

• I need to be able to update the status of an order i.e:preparing, out-for-delivery, delivered.

• When I exit my app, I need all data to be persisted and not lost.

• When I start myapp, I need to load all persisted data.

• I need to be sure my app has been tested and proven to work well.

• I need to receive regular software updates.
